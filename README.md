## About

Movie Suggestor uses a combination of the spotlite gem, the themoviedb gem, and some IMDB advanced search scraping to create a list of similar movies based on a variety of criteria. Internally, Movie Suggestor computes a similarity score for each movie based on genre, director, cast, and year of release.
